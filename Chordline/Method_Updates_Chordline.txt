Data Analysis Method Approach | Chordline  

Generally: using equivalent gradients of the unit NACA0018 airfoil surface as scaling method for the ‘real’ case.  

 
What we have done so far: 

1. Obtaining data of the general curve of NACA0018, which has a certain slope. The goal is to obtain a scaled version of this same type of airfoil.The interval of 0 to 25 mm from the leading edge is not deemed relevant for the analysis as the  

2. Given the mean values of the points in x,y space, interpolating a function of the surface curve. This entails interpolating through the data points (splines) determine alphas (see images) at x_0 and ksi_0. Ski_0 till  Ski_i refers to the newly created data points after the last observed data points. These should all be along the airfoil curve.  

3. Determining an algorithm to find the distance between x_0, ski_0. This also goes for the next data points x_1 to ski_1, … x_i to ski_i.  With the given data points, the slope at the ksi_i location can be computed using the derivative at that location. From this we can calculate the alphas (see image.)  

 
c. Iterative process in which every data point x_i relates to a new point ksi_i (see image) and thus angle theta_i can be determined. Then, theta(i) is compared to theta 0 from which then the location of the starting point x_0 can be known. The direction of the step from x_i to ksi_i should be done such that an arror of about 202 mm intersects with the curve. Theta_i and theta_0 will be determined by intersection of curves plotted on grid x [25, 400-a]. 

 

For the next session:  

Currently important to have the right spline such that what recreate the angles of the reference airfoil by finding a good approximation of theta_0.
