With the specifications of the NACA 0018 airfoil (as can be found on https://bit.ly/2ziwPnn), we subsequently want to look for a method that determines the positioning of the chord line of the airfoil at any value of the angles.
Generally, using equivalent gradients of the unit NACA0018 airfoil surface as reference for scaling to the ‘real’ case as a base for what the geometry looks like. So the overall idea is to have an iterative process based on the curvature of this reference airfoil, but a more detailed method is enumerated below. See the figure below for a more graphical approach.

    1. Given the mean values of the points in XY space as explained in the column method section, an interpolation is conducted to get an approximation of the surface curve of the real airfoil. This entails interpolating through the data points from the experiment in case 0. These should all be along the airfoil curve. In the images in this GitHub directory, xi till xi_i refer to the newly created data points after the last observed data points from the markers. To know where these xi points have to be, the reference airfoil is scaled and the curve is compared to the data points. The location is based on length a, as shown in one of the figures. a_1 should be slightly bigger than the distance from the first data point x_0 to the last data point, such that new curve data points can be created after this last point. Based on the case 0 data this is assumed to be about 250 mm.
    
    2. An algorithm should be written to find the distance between x_0 and xi_0, x_1 and xi_1 and so on. The slope at the xi_i location can be computed using the derivative at that location because proportional scaling doesn't affect gradient. From this we can calculate alpha_i in the figure. In this process every data point x_i relates to a new point xi_i and the angle theta_i can be determined. Then, theta_i is compared to theta_0 from which then the location of the starting point x_0 can be known. The direction of the step from x_i to xi_i should be done such that an error of about 202 [mm] intersects with the curve. theta_i and theta_0 will be determined by intersection of curves plotted on grid x [25, 400-a]. 


UPDATE 04-04-2020 --------------------------------------------------

Generally: using equivalent gradients of the unit NACA0018 airfoil surface as scaling method for the ‘real’ case.  

 
What we have done so far: 

1. Obtaining data of the general curve of NACA0018, which has a certain slope. The goal is to obtain a scaled version of this same type of airfoil.The interval of 0 to 25 mm from the leading edge is not deemed relevant for the analysis as the  

2. Given the mean values of the points in x,y space, interpolating a function of the surface curve. This entails interpolating through the data points (splines) determine alphas (see images) at x_0 and ksi_0. Ski_0 till  Ski_i refers to the newly created data points after the last observed data points. These should all be along the airfoil curve.  

3. Determining an algorithm to find the distance between x_0, ski_0. This also goes for the next data points x_1 to ski_1, … x_i to ski_i.  With the given data points, the slope at the ksi_i location can be computed using the derivative at that location. From this we can calculate the alphas (see image.)  

4. Iterative process in which every data point x_i relates to a new point ksi_i (see image) and thus angle theta_i can be determined. Then, theta(i) is compared to theta 0 from which then the location of the starting point x_0 can be known. The direction of the step from x_i to ksi_i should be done such that an arror of about 202 mm intersects with the curve. Theta_i and theta_0 will be determined by intersection of curves plotted on grid x [25, 400-a]. 


For the next session:  

Currently important to have the right spline such that what recreate the angles of the reference airfoil by finding a good approximation of theta_0.
